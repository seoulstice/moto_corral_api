# Moto Corral Finder [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/seoulstice/moto_corral_finder.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/seoulstice/moto_corral_finder)

### Purpose
The Philadelphia Parking Authority has created motorcycle specific parking corrals in various locations(54 to be exact) around the city, however the website displaying these corrals is not very user friendly nor is the data readily available through a consumable API.

The purpose of Moto Corral Finder is to create a consumable API which will be populated by data returned from scraping the Philadelphia Parking Authority website.
