# Moto Corral Finder [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/seoulstice/moto_corral_finder.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/seoulstice/moto_corral_finder)

### Purpose
The Philadelphia Parking Authority's website displaying [motorcycle parking corrals](http://www.philapark.org/motorcycle-scooter-parking/) is not very user friendly, nor does it offer a way for a User to search for a nearby corral based on the Users current location.  

The purpose of Moto Corral Finder is to create a consumable API which will be populated by data returned from periodically scraping the Philadelphia Parking Authority website for parking corral data.  This Rails API will be paired with a Vue.js frontend to allow a User to search for motorcycle parking corrals in two ways:  
1. Finding the closest parking corral from the User's current location.
2. Finding the closest parking corral from an address.
